There is different options out there for someone to edit their text on the web like ( Notepad++, Text Wrangler, BB Edit, VS Code, Atom, ...etc.) . Sometimes it can get overwhelming to find all these views on all the text editors there are. And it is hard to believe that one can alternate between all of them during the work process. So, it is best to reach some sort of satisfaction with a certain text editor. Although this is merely a personal matter, the developer can still sometimes benefit from other people’s experiences with different text editors. 


We can find all shades of opinions on the internet around The Terminal. Some find it basic and easy to deal with, whilst others believe it is too basic to be dealt with. Whether you are on this side or the other, you have to admit that The Terminal is one of the very useful ones ever found. It is thought to be a positive addition to the GUI rather than excluding it and leaving it behind. The process of designing a code to navigate through the computer can be an exhausting one, but a terminal can behave just as efficient.


Besides the point of accessibility, a terminal is also easy to use once you get the grip of it! It is accessible to most users as it is already found in most recent computers, a few moves  & updates and it can come in very handy! One can access different and various types of commands on a terminal to move around and navigate through the files. Commands can also be creating new ones, or deleting existing files. They also help through the process of installing/uninstalling of programs. This shows that it is a wide range of commands using only your keyboard and sets of words structured previously to perform changes like (pwd, ls, mkdir, …etc.).
