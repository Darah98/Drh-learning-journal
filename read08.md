### It summarizes the Comparison Operations in JavaScript
Regarding **Comparison Operators**, we are talking here about using signs like =, !, >, <, etc. We use these operators to evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what expect it might be. 
**What is Boolean?** Means *true* of *false*, these are the possible answers to the comparisons.

***Tranlation Guide for ~Dummies~ Beginners:***
* == : equal to
* != : is not equal to 
* === : strict equal to
* !== : strict not equal
* > : greater than
* < : less than
* >= : greater than or equal to 
* <= : less than or equal to

**What is a logical operator?** 
Operators used to compare results of more than one comparison operator. i.e AND && / OR && / NOT ! logical operators.

### &&
* T && T = T
* T && F = F
* F && T = F
* F && F = F

### ||
* T || T = T
* T || F = T
* F || T = T
* F || F = F

### ! 
* !T = F
* !F = T

**Types of *Loops***
1. for
2. while 
3. do while

for is used when repeating for a certain number of times.
for stucture:
 for ( var i = 0 ; i < 10 ; i + + )
intitialization ; condition ; update
syntax: for ( var i = 0 ; i < 10 ; i + + ) { document.write ( i ) }

while is used for open number of repititions.
