## Hello to all my non-tech friends. This will help you understand CSS.

CSS is not the easiest to deal with. for someone who is not familiar with the whole thing, it can be almost impossible to read the codes and things! **But**, good news is, this will break it down for you. CSS is basically a styling tool, which means it is all about the style here!
You bake the cake with all the ingredients needed, the you start designing it with sugary frostings, chocolate and cream! CSS is the chocolate and cream. 

CSS requires great imagination skills as it is advised that you imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element. This box will help you design this element and make changes to the other people see it. These CSS properties will affect how it is displayded. 

**There are different ways mentioned to do the process of styling:**
1. Inline styling
2. Enbedded styling
3. External styling

It is recommended *(even by this textbook)* that one uses an external styling sheet to apply changing to the html display. You can eventually link the .css file with the .html one.

The textbook explains the selectors and lists the different types providing the importance of each one of them. We can use the suitable selectors after navigating through chapter 10. 

Moving to chapter 11, specifically explaining color as a feature. We can see that we can play around with colors, contrast and different shades to achieve the coolest look to our website!
#### color can be presented with: 
* color name
* hsl, hsla
* opacity, rgba
