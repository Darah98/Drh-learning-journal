## New learnings from read06a
#### This was the last step of creating our glamorous site.

After we were done with the html coding, the css styling, we moved to creating a Java Script file to link it to the existing work.
We learnt how to link the file from JS through using < script src = " "> < / script >
We were also introduced to new types of functions and their use. We apply this in the lab using user input information which allows us to add the element of interaction to our website.
< prompt > and < confirm > are two examples of dynamic components one can use.
If conditional sentence was also covered in this assignment.

> JS makes the website alive! 



*Said by every single developer out there.
The importance of JS is huge in making a cool website.
