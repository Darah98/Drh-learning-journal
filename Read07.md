Regarding a *SCRIPT*: we learnt that to design one, we have to do certain steps that we can break into smaller ones to achieve a complete task.

In this reading we also learnt that an expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. 

The book also explained the different types of expressions:
1. Expressions that just assign a value to a variable
2. Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value

Operators also are essential. They have different types as they perform most of the work assigning values to vars.
