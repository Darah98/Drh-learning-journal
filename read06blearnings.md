### Behind the Scenes!

**So how do get an understanding of the way computers work?**
In today's reflection we are going to explain that in a simple language to all our interested non-technical friends!

To begin with, computers, like some other machines, were originally made to provide solutions. They specifically help us with the process of thinking. 

### ALL COMPUTERS DO THIS:
1. *INPUUT*
1. *STORE*
1. *PROCCESS*
1. *OUTPUT*
They use a binary system. The videos explain the electrical relation to the process in details. 

## History of computers
They were designed just to solve math problems. Now they help us communicate, play games, do business, transfer money, etc.  

They breakup pictures, sounds, videos and other medias into their basic units. pixels, signals, etc., which all also go back to 01 binary system. 

Circuts used to be big and clunky. However, now they are smaller and faster. They are used to make computers using the 01 / on&off system. The videos explain the different types of circuits including (and circuit, adder, etc.)

**examples of calculations circuits can perform:**
* SUBTRACTION
* MULTIPLICATION
* ADDITION

INPUT = all input devices
STORE = memory
PROCESS = CPU
OUTPUT = all output devices

### At the end of video 5, Madison Maxi pretty much summarized the whole concept in a vary simple sentence I very much liked:
> No matter what you want to do with a computer, every single action is about inputting information **from** the physical world, storing and processing that information, and getting some output back, **into** the physical world.
