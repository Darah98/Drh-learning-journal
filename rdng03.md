  In this reading, the main focus was on the process of linking and explaining what lies behind the whole cloud-developer relationship. It is super important that developers make sure every step they take is recorded and backed up. To achieve safety and secure the codes and information, developers link themselves to a larger networking system that can keep their data and different versions of work they have created. 

  There is a definite need for developers to know the secret ins and outs between Git and the Network to be able to use them. With that being said, there are certain commands a developer can use to perform the tasks needed. Between the processes of pushing & fetching, adding remotes, or even cloning your repositories, you can open the Git on your and make the changes you need to make and then find it on GitHub! **MAGIC!**
  
  To make the cloning process possible; it is important to memorize certain commands to link repos from GitHub to your personal Git.
  
  
  1. git clone 
  1. git add
  1. git commit
  1. git push
  1. ..etc.
