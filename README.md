*This is Darah, 21*

**Today's topic is about the path to success**

Climbing up the ladder of success is not easy at all, but having a growth mindset makes it easier for people to reach the top. To have a growth mindset means to think positively and have a better way of approaching hardships throughout the journy.
When talking about growth, is important to remember the following:
* Think positive
* Grow everyday
* Face obstacles 
* Get inspired by successful people
* Learn;
  * try new experiences
  * meet new people


And as Gandhi once said; 
> Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.

It is also mandatory that you keep positive lines in your mind to push yourself further whenever you get stuck.
1. Whenever you think of giving up, push yourself forward and never give up!
2. If you ever feel down because others are achieving and you are not, you be sure they were stuck at some point before getting there eventually.. so push harder!
3. The ultimate discouragement is fear! So whenever you feel scared, just calm yourself down and focus on achieving tasks in smaller piles. That way you will get things done!
